<h1>The Best Movies According to Me></h1>
<h2>Ayo, I can't pick from all time faves so here are 3 movies I've watched recently that I recommend you do too!</h2>
<hr />
<h3> Dune Part 1 & 2</h3>
<p>Yeah so I counted these movies as one package because you can't skip to the second before watching the first. Super amazing visuals and audio, highly recommend for the aesthetic alone.</p>
<h3> Yakuza games</h3>
<p>Yeah I ran out of movies already so I'm just saying you should probably watch these on Youtube or buy and play the games to experience the best bois ever</p>
<h3>Movie #3: TBD</h3>
<p>I am blanking rn so let's get back to this</p>
